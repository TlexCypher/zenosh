## Zenosh
Zenosh is a highly useful git prompt generator.

Zenosh is inspired by Robbyrussell oh-my-zsh themes.

Zenosh has lazy drawing functionality.

First of all, Zenosh draws instant prompt including `Git-Branch`, `Git-Status`, `Repository-Name`.

After drawing instant prompt, Zenosh draws full prompt including `Pull Request Status` related your current git branch.
